# Music Player Project - Railway Deployment Report

## Changes for SQL Server Deployment on Railway

### 1. Configuration Updates
- Updated `railway.json` to use npm start as the start command
- Updated `nixpacks.toml` to align with package.json scripts
- Created a dedicated `deploy-nixpacks.toml` for more precise control
- Fixed Procfile to use npm scripts
- Enhanced railway-up.js to handle copying of Railway-specific files
- Added proper environment variables for SQL Server in railway.toml

### 2. Database Connection
- Ensured Railway uses the SQL Server connection string from Repository.py.railway
- Used environment variables with format RAILWAY_DATABASE_HOST, RAILWAY_DATABASE_USER, etc.
- Created automatic file copying in multiple locations to ensure repository files are properly set
- Added a pre-deploy.sh script as an additional safeguard

### 3. Error Resolution
- Fixed "No start command could be found" error with clear nixpacks configuration
- Added proper Node.js engine specification in package.json
- Enhanced verification of Railway deployment with pre-deployment checks
- Added SQL Server ODBC driver to the nixpacks configuration
- Created a file-copying mechanism for Railway-specific versions of Repository.py

### 4. SQL Server Configuration
- Maintained the SQL Server configuration in railway.toml
- Ensured consistency between connection strings and environment variables
- Used the SQL Server Docker image: mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest
- Properly set up the credentials and database initialization process
- Created RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md with detailed deployment instructions
- Updated deployment scripts for Windows environment

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to Railway using `deploy-to-railway.ps1`
2. Verify that the SQL Server service is properly provisioned
3. Check database initialization via Railway logs
4. Test the deployed application functionality

## Railway Service Structure

The application is structured with multiple services:
1. flask-backend: Python Flask API (main web service)
2. node-backend: Node.js API (worker service)
3. frontend: Static React application
4. sqlserver: Microsoft SQL Server database

All services are configured to communicate with each other through Railway's service linking.
